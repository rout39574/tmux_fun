## Allen's tmux foo.


Daniel Crisman (https://github.com/crisman) slipped me a sweet sweet
dose of TMUX, and like a responsible adult, I rolled in it.



### What am I doing?

I'm taking lists of hosts, feeding them into shell scripts that
reformat them so, e.g. a list 8 items long will be arranged into a
tmux grid like so


|A|B|
|-|-|
|1|2|
|3|4|
|5|6|
|7|8|


Or maybe like

|A|B|C|D|
|-|-|-|-|
|1|2|3|4|
|5|6|7|8|


There are several repositories of lists of hosts in well defined
locations w.r.t. this directory.  You don't care about the lists of
hosts, you just care about what I'm doing with them.
